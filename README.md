# New In Town

### Game objective: 
Players will learn and solidify Chinese vocabulary in their memory through a sequence of listening to a dialogue, reviewing the associated vocabulary words, and subsequently at a significantly later time, answering questions that require memory of the vocabulary.  

The game will utilize existing podcasts on Chinesepod.com, but primarily use those dialogues that fit with the overarching theme defined by the game name:  New in Town.   In the game, the player will follow these simple steps:
1. Listen to the dialogue and view the words (and scene) at the same time
2. Review the key vocabulary – listening and viewing the words (along with an associated picture)
3. After an amount of time has elapsed: 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours or 24 hours, (a count-down timer displays remaining time), the player must answer a question requiring them recall one or more of the vocabulary word(s).  Players provide answers by using a popup keyboard and typing the required word(s) into the empty field.  Points are added to (or deducted from) a running total score based on a correct (incorrect) answer.

The prototype provides a working example of the skeletal structure of the game.  Features yet to be added during development include: 
- Art work appropriate to the dialogue
- Background (Chinese) music (to be discussed)
- Selectable options to view the dialogue via Pinyin, simplified, or traditional characters at the same time as the player listens to the dialogue, and when reviewing the vocabulary.  The same option will determine the form required for answering the subsequent questions.
- Multiple levels, Newbie, elementary, etc. associated with the dialogue level in Chinesepod.com.  At the Newbie level, vocabulary is provided, and answers are required in Pinyin along with tone numbers [1-4].  At higher levels selectable options for simplified or traditional characters are available.
- Selectable Chat-bot/friend to pose the questions.
- Opportunities to earn bonus points by correctly identifying non-dialogue, but common, vocabulary at random times.  Examples at the Newbie level include numbers 1-10, directions (bei[2], nan[2] …) , and colors.  At the Elementary level: seasons of the year, time of day, adverbs (always, never, often, sometimes, …).  At the Intermediate level, counting words, conjunctions, etc.

The structure of the game is based on the educational research findings presented by Peter Brown in his book “Make it Stick” in which the learning process is characterized as the effort to slow the forgetting process.   The book convincingly demonstrates that remembering, or learning information is best accomplished via the struggle to pull items from our fading memories rather than by looking at the information a second, third or fourth time.  The core idea for this game is to reward the process of pulling information back from the player’s fading memory and therefore enhance the process of making it stick.

### Examples (partly) used in the current prototype

Game Introduction (after opening the app):

Hi – it looks like you are new in town.  Welcome.  There are many things to discover here – good restaurants, beautiful sights, lots of fun places to visit and interesting things to do.
Listen carefully to the conversations around you.  You will need the information later in order to find your way around.  Just like in real life, you will want to use the key phrases and words not immediately, but later – like 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, or even 24 hours later.  Good luck.  And again – welcome to your new town.
